# HIGH_PRIORITY_MODULES_HANDOFF

## Summary of modules added
- Added first-class generated folders for `/product-strategy/`, `/requirements/`, `/security-risk/`, `/integrations/`, and `/architecture/`.
- Kept the beginner journey as `Decide -> Plan -> Design -> Build -> Test -> Handoff`.
- Mapped the new folders to beginner-friendly names so business users see simpler guidance while the AI agent gets deeper guardrails.

## Why these were chosen first
- Product Goal and Scope prevents the generator from building the wrong MVP.
- What the App Must Do makes the package build-ready by forcing concrete requirements and acceptance checks.
- Private Data and Safety Check protects secret handling, permissions, and private-data risk before code work drifts.
- External Services and Setup makes mocks, keys, environment variables, and failure behavior explicit before any dependency becomes hidden.
- Technical Plan gives the minimum architecture, data, API, and state plan needed to build safely without overengineering.

## Beginner-facing integration summary
- Updated generated beginner docs so the user still sees `Decide -> Plan -> Design -> Build -> Test -> Handoff`.
- Folded the new modules into Decide and Plan with these names:
  - `Product Goal and Scope`
  - `What the App Must Do`
  - `Private Data and Safety Check`
  - `External Services and Setup`
  - `Technical Plan`
- Repeated the guidance that business users do not need to open every folder.
- Explained that the detailed folders exist mainly as AI-agent guardrails and supporting material.

## Tests added
- Added deterministic existence and content checks for all five new module folders.
- Added beginner-doc checks for the new friendly names and unchanged six-stage journey.
- Added validator rules for required module sections, private-data projects, integration-heavy projects, and overbuilt architecture.
- Added quality-regression failures for:
  - missing product north star
  - missing MVP scope sections
  - missing acceptance criteria structure
  - missing security gate for sensitive projects
  - missing integration gate for external-service projects
  - architecture that contradicts a simple MVP

## Commands run
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run smoke`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:quality-regression`

## Test results
- `npm run typecheck`: PASS
- `npm run smoke`: PASS
- `npm run build`: PASS
- `npm run test:quality-regression`: PASS

## Known limitations
- Existing repo-local modifications and untracked files were left in place; this work was done without reverting unrelated changes.
- Integration and security content is generated for every package, but some projects will still show deferred or mock-only guidance when live services are not approved.
- Architecture overbuild detection is heuristic-based and intentionally conservative.

## Final recommendation
- PASS
