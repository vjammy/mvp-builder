# RC2 Research-Source Provenance + Demo/Client Readiness — Stabilization Report

Landed on: 2026-05-02 (post Phase E5)
Status header: **RC2 STABLE WITH REAL-RECIPE CALIBRATION PENDING**

## 1. Executive summary

Phase E delivered RC2 with 50/50 production-ready, mean 99/100, 0 caps fired.
Synth output scored very high structurally — but synth is a deterministic
regression harness, not a product critic. Showing a synth workspace to a real
client/demo audience would overclaim what the harness proves.

This pass adds an explicit research-source provenance, separates structural
**productionReady** from judgment-bearing **demoReady / clientReady**, and
caps synth on judgment-heavy expert dimensions so the ceiling reflects what
a deterministic harness can actually verify. Synth remains useful for 50-iter
regression. Real-recipe / imported-real / manual research becomes the only
path to demoReady / clientReady.

No regressions. 50-iter aggregate held: min 98 / median 99 / mean 99 / max 100.
50/50 production-ready. 50/50 research-grounded. 0/50 demo-ready (synth is
explicitly not demoReady).

## 2. Design summary

| Concept | Field | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| Research source | `meta.researchSource: 'synthesized' \| 'agent-recipe' \| 'imported-real' \| 'manual'` | research/extracted/meta.json |
| Production-ready | `audit.readiness.productionReady` | audit total ≥ 85 |
| Research-grounded | `audit.readiness.researchGrounded` | research/extracted/* present |
| Demo-ready | `audit.readiness.demoReady` | source + score + caps + artifacts |
| Client-ready | `audit.readiness.clientReady` | alias of demoReady (separated for future divergence) |

Backwards-compatible inference: when `researchSource` is missing,
`getResearchSource(meta)` falls back to inferring from `meta.researcher`:

- `researcher === 'mock'` → `synthesized`
- `researcher === 'anthropic-sdk' | 'claude-code-session'` → `agent-recipe`
- otherwise → `manual`

## 3. Readiness rule

```
productionReady   = audit.total ≥ 85
researchGrounded  = research/extracted/* present (FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md not flagged)

demoReady = clientReady =
     source ∈ { 'agent-recipe', 'imported-real', 'manual' }
  AND audit.total ≥ 95
  AND audit.expert.cap === 100
  AND meta.discovery.ideaCritique.length ≥ 1
  AND meta.discovery.competingAlternatives.length ≥ 1
  AND extractions.screens.length ≥ 1
  AND architecture/DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql exists
  AND extractions.testCases.length ≥ 1
  AND researchGrounded
```

When `demoReady` is false, `audit.readiness.reason` lists the specific failures
(e.g. "research source is synthesized — synth proves the generator is
structurally sound but cannot supply real product judgment").

## 4. Source-aware IDEA_CRITIQUE.md

The generator at `lib/generator/idea-critique.ts` now branches on `researchSource`:

- **synthesized**: renders an explicit limitation notice — "This is NOT a
  real product critique" — and instructs the agent to run
  docs/RESEARCH_RECIPE.md Pass 0. Does **not** invent competing alternatives.
- **agent-recipe / imported-real / manual**: renders the actual
  `ideaCritique[]` weak spots + mitigations and `competingAlternatives[]`,
  with adoption-risk follow-up questions for the human.

Test [test-research-source-readiness.ts:T4](scripts/test-research-source-readiness.ts) asserts both branches:
synth IDEA_CRITIQUE never names a real competitor; real IDEA_CRITIQUE never
contains the synth limitation notice.

## 5. Synthesized judgment cap rules

The synthesizer is a deterministic regression harness. It cannot supply real
product judgment. The audit caps synth on judgment-heavy expert dimensions:

| Dimension | Synth cap | Real-recipe cap | Reason |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| research-depth | 6/10 | 10/10 | Real recipe can populate ≥5-step workflows + decision points |
| edge-case-coverage | 7/10 | 10/10 | Real recipe can name domain-specific failure modes |
| idea-clarity | 2/5 | 5/5 | Critique credit only when source ≠ synthesized |
| screen-depth | uncapped | uncapped | Structural — synth proves it |
| schema-realism | uncapped | uncapped | Structural — synth proves it |
| test-case-grounding | uncapped | uncapped | Structural — synth proves it |
| jtbd-coverage | uncapped | uncapped | Structural — synth proves it |
| realistic-sample-data | uncapped | uncapped | Structural — synth proves it |
| role-permission-matrix | uncapped | uncapped | Structural — synth proves it |
| regulatory-mapping | uncapped | uncapped | Structural — synth proves it |

The synth caps **do NOT fire as expert blocker caps** — they do not pull the
total below 100. They simply prevent synth from claiming full judgment-heavy
credit and feed into `demoReady=false`. Headline score remains /100.

## 6. Synth vs real/imported behavior

| Aspect | Synth (mock) | Imported-real (full critique) |
|---|---|---|
| productionReady | true (when score ≥ 85) | true |
| researchGrounded | true | true |
| demoReady / clientReady | **false** | **true** (when artifacts complete) |
| idea-clarity | ≤ 2/5 | up to 5/5 |
| research-depth | ≤ 6/10 | up to 10/10 |
| edge-case-coverage | ≤ 7/10 | up to 10/10 |
| IDEA_CRITIQUE.md | limitation notice + recipe pointer | actual weak spots + alternatives |
| FINAL_SCORECARD demo block | "no — research source is synthesized" | "true when audit ≥ 95 + artifacts" |
| Audit headline | typically 99/100 | up to 100/100 |
| Loop-50 regression aggregate | min 98 / median 99 / mean 99 / max 100 (held) | n/a (single brief at a time) |

## 8. Tests added or updated

| Test | What it asserts |
|---|---|
| `npm run test:research-source-readiness` (T1) | Synth: productionReady=true, researchGrounded=true, demoReady=false. research-depth ≤ 6, edge-case-coverage ≤ 7, idea-clarity ≤ 2. No expert cap fires due to synth limitations. |
| `npm run test:research-source-readiness` (T2) | Imported-real with critique + alternatives + screens + DDL + test cases: demoReady=true, idea-clarity ≥ 4. |
| `npm run test:research-source-readiness` (T3) | Imported-real but ideaCritique=[] → demoReady=false; reason cites missing critique. |
| `npm run test:research-source-readiness` (T4) | IDEA_CRITIQUE.md text differs by source; synth never invents alternatives. |
| `npm run test:audit-exit` (existing) | Still passes — no regression to audit-exit gating. |
| `npm run test:audit-exit-e2e` (existing) | Still passes — no regression to end-to-end audit-exit. |
| `npm run test:quality-regression` (existing) | Still passes — synth bundle assertions unchanged. |
| `npm run smoke` (existing) | Still passes — 402 files / 14 phases. |

## 9. Workflow-name examples (before / after)

The previous workflow-name derivation took the questionnaire's
`primary-workflow` answer and ran `titleCase(...).slice(0, 60)`, which
produced sentence-fragment names like:

> "Sales Development Reps And Their Managers. Sets Up The Works"

`pickPrimaryVerb` was introduced earlier and is expanded in this pass with
more verb categories. Current names from the 50-brief corpus:

| Brief | Workflow names |
|---|---|
| SDR Sales Module | Track Sales · Review Sales · Manage members |
| Family Task Board | Manage Family · Review Family · Manage members |
| HOA Portal | Manage HOA · Review HOA · Manage members |
| PTO Tracker | Track PTO · Review PTO · Manage members |
| Inventory (Small Biz) | Track Catalog · Review Catalog · Manage members |
| Tutor Matchboard | Manage Tutor · Review Tutor · Manage members |
| Volunteer Manager | Track Volunteer · Review Volunteer · Manage members |

All names are short, action-oriented, and ID-stable across reruns.

## 10. Loop-state cleanup fix

`scripts/loop-50-iterations.ts` already removes the per-iter `outDir/` and
`research-input/` trees before each iteration. RC2 adds a belt-and-braces
explicit removal of `repo/mvp-builder-loop-state.json` so a future refactor
that splits `outDir` cleanup cannot regress to the old "loop-dry no-ops with
status='max-iterations'" failure mode.

## 11. Real-recipe SDR calibration: skipped

**Status: skipped.**

The environment has:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""` (unset)
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat...` (present, but the Anthropic API
  rejects OAuth bearer tokens with "OAuth authentication is currently not
  supported" — validated in Phase A4)

Per project memory `audit_exit_criterion.md`, the SDK runtime path is gated
on a raw API key. Without one, a real-recipe SDR run would either fail or
require fabricating output, which the prompt explicitly forbids
("If no usable credential is available, do not fake the run").

**Follow-up.** When a raw `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` becomes available:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-real-research-on-brief.ts \
  --input=examples/sdr-sales-module.json \
  --out=.tmp/rc2-real-sdr \
  --audit-threshold=95 \
  --audit-max-retries=2 \
  --respect-caps
npm run create-project -- \
  --input=examples/sdr-sales-module.json \
  --out=.tmp/rc2-real-sdr-pkg \
  --research-from=.tmp/rc2-real-sdr
npm run audit -- --package=.tmp/rc2-real-sdr-pkg
```

The audit JSON should report `readiness.researchSource: 'agent-recipe'` and
(if the recipe Pass 0 produces ≥3 critique items + ≥1 alternative)
`readiness.demoReady: true`.

The synth-vs-real comparison table will be filled in once that run completes.

## 12. Validation table

## 13. 50-iteration result

| Metric | Pre-RC2 (Phase E5) | Post-RC2 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Min | 98 | 98 |
| Median | 99 | 99 |
| Mean | 99 | 99 |
| Max | 100 | 100 |
| Production-ready | 50/50 | 50/50 |
| Research-grounded | 50/50 | 50/50 |
| Caps fired | 0/50 | 0/50 |
| Demo-ready | n/a (no field) | 0/50 (all synth) |
| Smoke files | 402 | 402 |
| Expert dimensions | 10 | 10 |

Headline score remains /100. Synth caps on research-depth (≤6) and
edge-case-coverage (≤7) had no measurable effect on aggregate because synth
already converged at exactly those values.

## 14. Remaining limitations

1. **Real-recipe SDR calibration is pending.** All synth-vs-real comparison
   numbers are still based on the Phase A4 baseline (pre-E2-E4 schema).
2. **`demoReady` is binary.** A nuanced "demo-ready for internal stakeholders
   but not external prospects" gradient is not modeled. If needed, split
   `clientReady` from `demoReady` at the readiness rule level (the audit
   result already keeps them distinct fields).
3. **The audit's IDEA_CRITIQUE check for demoReady is presence-only** — it
   doesn't assess critique *quality*. A weakly-populated `ideaCritique[]`
   with one-word mitigations would still pass. A future "critique quality"
   sub-dimension could close this.
4. **`researchSource: 'manual'`** is allowed to claim demo-readiness if all
   other conditions hold. This is intentional (test fixtures, hand-authored
   demos) but means an operator could theoretically write
   `researchSource: 'manual'` into a synth workspace to bypass the synth
   cap. The audit treats this as fixture intent, not abuse.

## 15. Final recommendation

**RC2 STABLE WITH REAL-RECIPE CALIBRATION PENDING**

- Synth remains a strong, fast, deterministic regression harness.
- Synth no longer masquerades as client/demo-ready.
- Real-recipe / imported-real / manual research is the only path to
  demoReady / clientReady, with explicit artifact requirements.
- Headline score remains /100.
- 50-iter aggregate held: mean 99, no regressions.
- Real-recipe SDR calibration awaits a raw `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and is
  documented as a follow-up.
