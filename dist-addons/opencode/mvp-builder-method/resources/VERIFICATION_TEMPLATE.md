# VERIFICATION_TEMPLATE

## When to verify

After completing implementation for a phase, before creating the handoff summary.

```markdown

```

## Evidence checklist

Check all items in `EVIDENCE_CHECKLIST.md`:

- [ ] Required files reviewed
- [ ] Required commands run
- [ ] Expected artifacts produced
- [ ] Exit criteria confirmed
- [ ] Blockers reviewed
- [ ] Known limitations recorded
- [ ] Handoff summary completed
- [ ] Next phase context updated

## Recommendation rules

- **proceed**: exit gate passes, tests pass, no unresolved blockers
- **revise**: exit gate fails or tests fail, but work can be corrected
- **blocked**: fundamental blockers prevent phase completion

## Advancing

Use `/mvp-builder-next` with evidence:
```bash
npm run next-phase -- --package=./output --evidence=phases/phase-01/VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
```

Or with manual approval:
```bash
npm run next-phase -- --package=./output --approve=true
```
